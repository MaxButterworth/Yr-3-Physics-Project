# Yr-3-Physics-Project

Experimental work completed by Max L. Butterworth and Alex S. Bush.

This is a repository containing all the Python scripts used to process data, including: calculating sample temperatures, plotting spectra, and other graphs. The linear fit parameters for GaAs and GaP intensity versus wavelength spectra and transmission versus wavelength spectra are also provided.
